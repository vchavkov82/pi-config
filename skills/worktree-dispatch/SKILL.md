name: worktree-dispatch
description: Full git worktree lifecycle for Cursor agent task dispatch. Creates a worktree and task branch, writes the task brief, launches cursor-agent via cmux, monitors for questions and auto-answers them, then verifies, merges, and cleans up on completion. Use when "dispatch to cursor", "cursor worktree", "run this in cursor", "create worktree for task", "checkout worktree", "dispatch task to agent", "send to cursor agent", or "open in cursor". Requires pi + cmux environment.

# Worktree Dispatch

Manages the full lifecycle of a cursor-agent task in an isolated git worktree:

**create worktree → write brief → launch worker → check status → verify → merge → clean up**

Use `cursor-dispatch` instead when the worktree already exists.

## Execution model

cursor-agent runs **headless** (`--print --force`) inside a cmux surface and exits when done.
The monitor phase is **not a blocking loop** — pi checks status once per call, reports, then waits
for the user or itself to trigger the next check. This keeps pi responsive throughout.

## When NOT to Use

- Single-file fixes or tasks under ~30 minutes of work
- No written task spec or clear requirements
- Outside a git repository

disable-model-invocation: true

## Configuration

Read `.worktree-dispatch.yml` from the project root if it exists:

```yaml
# .worktree-dispatch.yml
worktrees_dir: .worktrees    # directory for git worktrees (default: .worktrees)
branch_prefix: cursor/       # task branch prefix (default: cursor/)
verify_cmd: mise run test    # verification command run inside worktree
auto_merge: true             # false = pause before merge for explicit approval
agent: cursor                # cursor | codex | pi
```

Per-invocation overrides accepted as natural language: "skip verify", "no auto merge", "use codex".

disable-model-invocation: true

## Pre-flight Checks

Before creating the worktree:

1. Run `git status` — must be clean on main. Stash or commit any pending changes.
2. Check `.gitignore` — add `.worktrees/` if missing, then commit.
3. Confirm `cursor/<slug>` branch does not already exist (`git branch --list cursor/<slug>`).

disable-model-invocation: true

## Phase 1: Setup

Derive a **slug** from the task title: lowercase, hyphens only, ≤40 chars.
Example: "Add user profile page" → `add-user-profile-page`

```bash
# From the repo root:
git worktree add .worktrees/<slug> -b cursor/<slug>
```

Resulting structure:

```
<repo-root>/
├── .worktrees/
│   └── <slug>/               ← isolated worktree on cursor/<slug>
│       ├── .tasks/
│       │   └── TASK.md       ← task brief (written in Phase 2)
│       └── .cursor/
│           └── rules/
│               └── task.mdc  ← always-apply cursor rule (written in Phase 2)
└── .gitignore                ← must include .worktrees/
```

disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Phase 2: Brief

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_ROOT}/references/task-brief-template.md` for the TASK.md template.

Write `.tasks/TASK.md` inside the worktree. Fill in every section:

- **Title** and **Context** — from the task description and surrounding codebase context
- **Requirements** — numbered, specific, testable; one action per item
- **Files to Modify** — explicit paths, no globs; list every file the worker should touch
- **Acceptance Criteria** — unchecked `[ ]` boxes, each independently verifiable
- **Notes** — scope limits and explicit non-goals
- Leave **Questions** empty and omit the `STATUS:` line initially

Write `.cursor/rules/task.mdc` inside the worktree:

```markdown
disable-model-invocation: true
---
description: "Active task instructions"
alwaysApply: true
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Read `.tasks/TASK.md` for the full task specification and implement it completely.

Constraints:
- Only modify files listed under "Files to Modify"
- Run the project's verify command before committing
- Commit with: `feat: <task title>`
- Write `STATUS: complete` at the top of TASK.md when done
- Write `STATUS: blocked` and `QUESTION: <text>` in the Questions section if stuck — then stop.
  The orchestrator will answer and re-run you.
```

If the project already has `.cursor/rules/` files on main, copy them into `.worktrees/<slug>/.cursor/rules/` alongside `task.mdc` (copy, not symlink — branches must be self-contained).

disable-model-invocation: true

## Phase 3: Launch

Open a cmux surface and start cursor-agent inside the worktree. cursor-agent runs headlessly
and **exits when done** — success (STATUS: complete) or blocked (STATUS: blocked + QUESTION).

```bash
SURFACE=$(cmux new-surface --type terminal | awk '{print $2}')
sleep 0.5

WORKTREE_PATH="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.worktrees/<slug>"
PROMPT="Read .tasks/TASK.md and implement it completely. Write STATUS: complete at the top when done. If stuck, write STATUS: blocked and QUESTION: <text> in the Questions section, then stop."

cmux send --surface $SURFACE "cd $WORKTREE_PATH && cursor-agent --print --force \"$PROMPT\"\n"
```

Poll until cursor-agent produces output (max 20 seconds):

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  OUT=$(cmux read-screen --surface $SURFACE --lines 10)
  echo "$OUT" | grep -qi "reading\|task\|implement\|cursor" && break
  sleep 1
done
cmux read-screen --surface $SURFACE --lines 20
```

Record `$SURFACE` and `$WORKTREE_PATH` — needed for checks and cleanup.

disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Phase 4: Check

**This phase is a single call, not a loop.** Run it once, report the result, then either
proceed or wait for the next trigger (user asks "check status", or schedule a re-check).

```bash
TASK=$(cat "$WORKTREE_PATH/.tasks/TASK.md")
SURFACE_OUT=$(cmux read-screen --surface $SURFACE --scrollback --lines 80)
```

### STATUS: complete

cursor-agent finished. Notify and proceed to Phase 5 (Verify).

```bash
cmux notify --title "worktree-dispatch" --body "Task complete — verifying <slug>"
```

### STATUS: blocked

cursor-agent stopped and left a question. Find unanswered `QUESTION:` lines
(a line starting with `QUESTION:` not immediately followed by `ANSWER:`):

1. Read the full TASK.md and relevant codebase context
2. Formulate a concrete answer — no hedging, no "it depends"
3. Edit TASK.md: insert `ANSWER: <text>` immediately after the `QUESTION:` line
4. Remove the `STATUS: blocked` line from TASK.md
5. Re-run cursor-agent in the same surface with a resume prompt:

```bash
RESUME="Read .tasks/TASK.md again — I answered your question in the Questions section. Continue implementing."
cmux send --surface $SURFACE "cursor-agent --print --force \"$RESUME\"\n"
```

Then re-enter Phase 4 on the next check trigger.

```bash
cmux notify --title "worktree-dispatch" --body "Question answered — cursor-agent resuming on <slug>"
```

### No STATUS line yet

Detect whether cursor-agent is still running or exited silently by checking for a shell
prompt at the end of the surface. When cursor-agent exits, the shell prompt appears:

```bash
LAST=$(cmux read-screen --surface $SURFACE --lines 5)
echo "$LAST" | grep -qE '[$#%>] *$' && AGENT_EXITED=true || AGENT_EXITED=false
```

**Still running** (`AGENT_EXITED=false`): show progress and wait.

```bash
echo "$SURFACE_OUT" | tail -30
```

Report: "Still running — trigger another check when ready." Do not block waiting.

**Exited silently** (`AGENT_EXITED=true`, no STATUS in TASK.md): cursor-agent crashed or
hit an unhandled error. Read full scrollback and escalate:

```bash
cmux read-screen --surface $SURFACE --scrollback --lines 200
```

Show the full output to the user and escalate.

disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Phase 5: Verify

Run inside the worktree, **not** the repo root:

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
<verify_cmd>    # e.g.: mise run test && mise run lint
```

If verification fails:

- **Fixable** (formatting, lint): fix in the worktree and re-verify
- **Test failure**: append a `## Failure` section to TASK.md with the error output, then re-launch cursor-agent as in the Q&A resume flow above with prompt: "Fix the failing tests — details in the Failure section of TASK.md."
- After 3 failed verify cycles: show output to user, do not merge

Do not proceed to Phase 6 until verification is clean.

disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Phase 6: Merge

From the repo root:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge cursor/<slug> --no-ff -m "Merge cursor/<slug>: <task title>"
```

**On conflict:** Stop immediately. Show the conflicting files and wait for user resolution. Do not auto-resolve.

If `auto_merge: false`: show the diff (`git diff main..cursor/<slug>`) and wait for explicit user approval before running the merge command.

Post-merge, re-run verify from the repo root to confirm nothing broke.

disable-model-invocation: true
---

## Phase 7: Cleanup

Run this regardless of how the workflow ended — done, blocked, or error.

```bash
# Remove the worktree
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force

# Delete the task branch (only if merge succeeded)
git branch -d cursor/<slug>

# Close the cmux surface
cmux close-surface --surface $SURFACE
```

If the merge did not happen (blocked or error path), delete the branch **only after explicit user confirmation**.

disable-model-invocation: true

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| cursor-agent fails to start | Read surface output, show error to user, run Phase 7 cleanup |
| `STATUS: blocked` with no QUESTION | Ask user for direction; treat as manual intervention required |
| cursor-agent exits silently (no STATUS) | Read full scrollback, show to user, escalate |
| Verify fails after 3 retries | Show failure output to user, do not merge, run Phase 7 cleanup |
| Merge conflict | Stop, show conflicting files, wait for user resolution, then continue |
| cmux surface dies unexpectedly | Re-launch cursor-agent in a new surface with `--print --force "<resume prompt>"` |
| Worker diverges from main (rebase needed) | `cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && git rebase main`, then re-verify before merge |
